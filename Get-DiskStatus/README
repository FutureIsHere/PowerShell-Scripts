The script checks health status of disk volumes using "diskpart" and creates an event in the EventLog.

Windows 7 does not generate any events when built-in software RAID disk is failed.
This script is a work-around, which could help to notify the user when it's happened.
(NOTE! It supposed to be fixed in Windows 8)
This problem is discussed on few resources. For example: 
"http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/5d3c3d5c-38ee-4a3d-9243-17712556eab8/windows-7-has-no-notification-of-raid-failure"
It checks health status of all disks attached to the local host (Except "Removable"!!!).
If the status is Failed, it generates an event in the System log.
You can change event's parameters in "Constants" region.
You need to add this script to the Task Scheduller and check the EventLog regurally.
Also you could create a task which will send e-mail or show a message window in case of the volume failure (the event).
The script uses "diskpart" utility.
