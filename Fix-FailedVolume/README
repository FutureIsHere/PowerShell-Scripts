The script verifies the disk volumes status. If one of volumes is "Failed", it generates an error message and try to recover the volume.
The script is made mostly to recover software RAID volumes.
It was found that Windows 7 does not generate any events when built-in software RAID disk is failed.
The script waits until rebuilding process has finished. It verifies volume's status periodicly and generates the events.
If the rebuild has not completed successfully, the error event will be generated.
All events could monitored by creating a task (e-mail or pop-up message).
The script uses "diskpart" utility.

You can modify the EventLog parameters by changing the constants.

If you need only to create an event in case of volume's failure, you could use another my script:
